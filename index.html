            <h2>The Legacy of Egyptian Innovation</h2>
            <p>Throughout history, Egypt has been regarded as a global center of invention and scientific advancement. Today, that spirit of innovation faces a modern challenge: the escalating crisis of Electronic Waste (e-waste). As our society transitions deeper into the digital age, the debris of yesterday's technology threatens our environmental future. <strong>ReGen Fuge</strong> was born from the necessity to bridge the gap between waste and utility, transforming discarded household components into high-precision laboratory tools.</p>

            <h2>Project Abstract</h2>
            <div class="card">
                <p>Egypt currently produces approximately <strong>605 kt of e-waste annually</strong>, a figure growing at a staggering rate of 35% per year. While this waste represents a potential $100 million recovery opportunity in precious metals, recycling rates remain under 15%. ReGen Fuge addresses this "valorization" gap by repurposing universal motors and potentiometers from decommissioned kitchen mixers. Our system achieves a maximum of <strong>1650 RPM</strong> and <strong>90% water purity</strong>, proving that resource-constrained economies can produce high-efficiency scientific equipment through upcycling.</p>

        <section id="problem">
            <h2>The E-Waste Challenge in Egypt</h2>
            <p>The total annual waste in Egypt reached more than 13.5 million tons in 2024. This is not just an environmental statistic; it is a public health emergency.</p>

                    <h3>Environmental Impact</h3>
                    <p>Discarded electronics release hazardous heavy metals and gases, contributing to 0.8% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Improper incineration pollutes the air and groundwater across 20+ major garbage dumps in Egypt.</p>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Socio-Economic Risks</h3>
                    <p>The current waste management landscape leads to severe community issues, including the prevalence of child labor at dump sites and chronic health conditions such as brain damage, respiratory failure, and insomnia.</p>

            <h2>Advancing Beyond the "Dremel Fuge"</h2>
            <p>While DIY centrifuges like the <em>Dremel Fuge</em> have been used in the past, they often suffer from high costs and limited torque. The ReGen Fuge offers a superior alternative:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cost Efficiency:</strong> Utilizes 100% reclaimed motors, reducing manufacturing costs significantly.</li>
                <li><strong>Variable Control:</strong> Integrated potentiometer allows for precise speed adjustment across two distinct speed modes.</li>
                <li><strong>Stability:</strong> Custom-engineered plywood and plastic housing provides a robust safety barrier during high-RPM operations.</li>
            </ul>
