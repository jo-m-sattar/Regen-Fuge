            Validation was conducted using three unique samples: water mixed with starch,
            sand, and ground coffee. These samples were selected to represent a range of
            particle sizes and densities.

        <h2>Results and Analysis</h2>

        <p>
            Egypt’s rapidly increasing population and consumption of electronic devices
            have led to a sharp rise in electronic waste generation. With a population
            exceeding 100 million as of 2025, thousands of tons of waste are produced
            annually, creating significant environmental and public health concerns.
            This challenge presents an opportunity to repurpose discarded household
            appliances into functional scientific equipment.

        <h3>Prototype Performance Evaluation</h3>

        <p>
            The centrifuge prototype was constructed using a universal motor extracted
            from an old mixer, capable of operating between 1500 and 1700 RPM. A
            potentiometer was employed to regulate voltage and control motor speed,
            while a 3D-printed rotor securely held six test tubes. All components were
            mounted on a reclaimed wooden base and enclosed within a transparent casing
            for operational safety.
        </p>

        <h3>Trial Results</h3>

        <p>
            During the first trial, worn motor brushes limited the achievable rotational
            speed to 900 RPM, resulting in a low water purity of 60%. After replacing the
            brushes, Trial 2 achieved 1200 RPM, improving water purity to 75% and
            demonstrating the direct relationship between rotational speed and
            separation efficiency.
        </p>

                increased following motor brush replacement.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            In Trial 3, replacing the potentiometer allowed precise voltage control
            according to Ohm’s Law (V = IR), enabling the motor to reach an optimal
            speed of 1650 RPM. This resulted in a substantial increase in water purity
            to approximately 90%.
